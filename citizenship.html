      <h1>Citizenship</h1>
      <p>Citizenship is the character of an individual viewed as a member of society; behavior in terms of the duties, obligations, and functions of a citizen. The five main components in citizenship are honesty, compassion, respect, responsibility, and courage.</p>
      <h2>Honesty</h2>
      <p>Honesty is telling the truth and not lying. This is an important component of citizenship because a society can’t function well if it is full of liars.<p>
      <h3>Compassion</h3>
      <p>Compassion is feeling bad for someone who had a bad experience and helping them out. This is important in citizenship because everyone has to be willing to help eachother out for a society to thrive.</p>
      <h4>Respect</h4>
      <p>Respect is to honor someone and their opinions. This is important because if nobody respected each other everyone would think they are more important than other people and there would be lots of fighting.</p>
      <h5>Responsibility</h5>
      <p>Responsibility is an obligation for a certain person to perform an act to benefit themselves or someone else. This is important because if no one felt they had to be responsible for others then they wouldn’t raise their own children or do their jobs.</p>
      <h6>Courage</h6>
      <p>Courage is the ability to face something hard or unwanted. This is important in citizenship because without courage people would always back away from their fears and never confront them making daily life difficult.</p>
      <h7>Kindness</h7>
      <p>Kindness is important for citizenship because if people aren’t generally nice to each other then there would be nothing to work for or look forward to.</p>
      <h8>Recent Act</h8>
      <p>The most recent act of powerful citizenship I’ve seen is J.J. Watt raising millions of dollars for Hurricane Harvey relief.</p>
